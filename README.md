## Speed typing game
Is a **Vanilla JS Web game** where you race against the clock to type out a randomly generated quote. Playing this game greatly increases typing speed and accuracy.

## Main functionalities
The app takes a quote from an api breaks the text into single letter spans whose contents can be identified. User is actually typing into a hidden textarea. While typing each letter is checked for a match. The user can't proceed untill they enter the correct letter. 

The progress is stored in localstorage for the user to keep track of the character count for each typed out text, how long it took to type out and how many errors they made.


## Possible future update
The design is pretty rudimentary. Only bootstrap was used for quick styling. So I will possibly make it look good üëç

Update: I just made it dark and responsive.

## Install
